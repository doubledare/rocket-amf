== DESCRIPTION:

RocketAMF is a full featured AMF0/3 serializer and deserializer with support for
Flash -> Ruby and Ruby -> Flash class mapping, custom serializers, remoting
gateway helpers that follow AMF0/3 messaging specs, and a suite of specs to
ensure adherence to the specification documents put out by Adobe. In addition,
it now fully supports Ruby 1.9.

== Reason for fork

warhammerkid's version fails on Ruby 1.8.6

== INSTALL:

  gem install RocketAMF --source="http://gemcutter.org"

== SIMPLE EXAMPLE:

  require 'rocketamf'

  hash = {:apple => "Apfel", :red => "Rot", :eyes => "Augen"}
  File.open("amf.dat", 'w') do |f|
    f.write RocketAMF.serialize(hash, 3) # Use AMF3 encoding because it's smaller
  end
